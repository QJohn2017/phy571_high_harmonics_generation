\title{High Order Harmonic Generation : Classical Model}

\begin{document}

\maketitle

\section{Introduction to Simple Man's Model}

High Order Harmonic Generation (HHG) is a quantum mechanical process. It is, however, extremely useful to have worked through the classical problem of a charged particle in an electromagnetic field before dealing with the full complexity of HHG. This semi-classical treatment is often referred to as the Simple Man's Model.\\
In this model, the electron tunnels into the continuum through the atomic potential, which is deformes due to the strong laser field. After tunneling into the continuum, the electron is accelerated away from the atom by the laser field. At a later time the laser field changes sign and the electron is pulled back toward the atom. The electron can recombine with the atom and radiate some photons. The photon energy is the sum of the binding potential and kinetic energy of the returning electron due to energy conservation.

\section{Key steps}
Here are presented the main tasks which will be implemented concerning the classical problem :\\

$\bullet$ Integration of the movement equation using the \textbf{odeint} function.\\

$\bullet$ Plot a series of graph for $x(t)$ and $E(t)$ for several times of ionization $t_{\mathrm{ionization}}$. Interpretation : Existence or not of the return time. Existence only if $t_{\mathrm{ionization}} \in \left[\frac{T}{4};\frac{T}{2}\right] \cup \left[\frac{3T}{4};T\right]$ \\

$\bullet$ Find the return time $t_{\mathrm{return}}$ as a function of $t_{\mathrm{ionization}}$ using the \textbf{scipy.optimize.brenth} function.\\

$\bullet$ Plot $t_{\mathrm{return}}$ as a function of $t_{\mathrm{ionization}}$. Physical interpretation of the result.\\

$\bullet$ Plot the value of the kinetic energy $E_{kin}$ at the return time as a function of $t_{\mathrm{ionization}}$.\\


\section{The files.py}
The aim of this section is to briefly explain the function of every file.\\

$\bullet$ \textbf{Integration.py :} used to derive the solution from the movement equation. The \textbf{odeint} function has been chosen to perform the integration.The system needs to be written under the vectorial notation y=[x,x'] where one is looking for y'=[x',x''].\\

$\bullet$ \textbf{Physical\_quantities.py :} definition of the physical quantities in (u.a) \\

$\bullet$ \textbf{Useful\_functions.py :} contains all the functions which will be usefull for the project. e.g : Electric Field for the laser source, theoretical solution for the movement, etc...\\

$\bullet$ \textbf{color.py :} used to build a gradient of N colors between two colors given in the RGB notation.\\

$\bullet$ \textbf{trajectory\_evolution.py :} used to plot the evolution of the trajectory with respect to the time. The indidence of the ionization time $t'$ on the result is studied.
$t'$ is the time when the electron leaves the atomical orbit. It's the beginning of the classical solution. We define here a vector of $t'$ of length Number\_of\_t\_prime.
\\

$\bullet$ \textbf{find\_Treturn.py :} calculation of the return time $t''$ when it exists.\\


\section{Results}

The results are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:averages}. When you show a figure, make
sure the labels are large enough and that the caption has all the necessary details
to understand what the figure is and how it was obtained.
