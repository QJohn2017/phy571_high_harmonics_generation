# phy571_high_harmonics_generation
**numerical physics project**

This repository is a project aiming at studying high harmonics generation by laser pulses.

**Groundwave.py** : Compute the groundstate of the soft-coulomb potential using wick's rotation, then write the resulting array in a separated .npy file.

**Groundstate** : An array representing the groundstate wavefunction of a soft-coulomb potential.
